# Script-Tools
Usefull scripts for console tasks with a nice Text User Interface, powered by SWARM

Easy to use, cross-plattform-compatilble directory based but still directly accessible scripts.



NOTE:
-----
CURRENTLY UNSTABLE!!

SWARM is now stable enough to start (re-)working on this all-in-one project (Script-Tools), but (SWARM) also still needs some more work to be done (fine tuning, fix not yet encountered issues).



Requirements:
-------------
* BASH 4+
* [SWARM](https://github.com/sri-arjuna/SWARM)
* Optional requirements depending on different tasks (like ffmpeg for VHS)



Features:
---------
* Helpers for: EFI, GIT, GRUB2, SSH
* Connect wifi | nas/samba
* VHS (Video Handler Script)
* Forum Signature Generator
* And lots more
